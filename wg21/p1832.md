# Improving Debug Builds Inline With User Expectation

## Abstract

Users frequently complain that modern C++ abstractions
make it hard to debug their programs.
This document explores some of the reasons for these complaints and
suggests a possible solution for implementers.

## Introduction

This document is written in response to the assertion that
"non-optimized build performance is important" as stated in the article,
["Modern" C++ Lamentations](https://aras-p.info/blog/2018/12/28/Modern-C-Lamentations/).
The article, written by a game developer, sparked 
[a discussion](https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/d/topic/sg14/Zx3b2rgpYck/discussion)
on the SG14 reflector which did not result in any action.

More recently, SG6 and SG14 reviewed linear algebra papers in Cologne
and game development was identified as a target audience for these
library components. Without any further action to address the assertion,
those components — and an increasing proportion of the standard library
as a whole — will be ignored by a growing number of C++ users.

It is the author's view
that the assertion forewarns of a scalability problem
that C++ must address in order to remain relevant.

## Background

### Debug Builds

During the development cycle, it is common for C++ users to produce
binaries that are optimised for testing and debugging. These are often
called *debug builds* — to be contrasted with *release builds* which
are optimised for performance.

It is accepted that the debug builds are bigger and execute more slowly
than release builds of the same program.
They may include correctness checks, symbol information
and debugging information.
They may also disable optimizations which
hamper the compiler's ability to provide helpful debugging information.

### Function Inlining

A very common optimization which causes the loss of debugging
information is *function inlining*. Function inlining effectively
removes functions and, in doing so, removes debugging information
associated with those functions. In particular, **debug builds disable
function inlining**.

The lack of function inlining is one reason why
a debug build may be bigger and execute more slowly.

### Library-Based Abstractions

Unfortunately, an increasing number of C++ abstractions rely heavily on
function inlining in order to maintain zero run-time overhead.
They are found in — both standard library implementations and —
third-party libraries. They are characterised by
deep call trees which collapse down to efficient machine code.

### The Dilemma

Without function inlining, many library abstractions incur significant
cost in terms of binary size and run-time performance.
With function inlining, the same abstractions obfuscate
stack traces and otherwise hamper the ability of tools to provide
the user with helpful debugging information.

This causes a dilemma which is felt most acutely in abstractions which
have the highest ratio of compile-time complexity to run-time code
generation.

For example, many numerics libraries offer user-friendly abstractions
over fundamental arithmetic types.
A substantial amount of source code will routinely result in
[a single arithmetic instruction](https://godbolt.org/z/easvxD).
However, the problem is [ranges](https://godbolt.org/z/DHshRI)
far beyond purely arithmetic abstractions.

## Problem Analysis

### One User's Solution is Another User's Problem

One way in which **library designers attempt to address concerns over
performance** of debug builds is to try and single out their functions
for inlining. **This fails** for two reasons.

Firstly, explicit inlining as an optimization hint is a mistake.
A modern tool chain does a far better job of determining
if a function is a good candidate for inlining. Many factors contribute
to this determination including: target platform, caller, build
configuration and profile guidance. Assuming the user made the right
choice on a given day (unlikely), the same choice may be wrong
tomorrow.

Secondly, **the intent to inline is based on ownership of the
function**. It's likely that users of the library DO wish for
inlining of its functions in debug builds. Conversely, authors of the
library DO NOT wish for inlining of the very same functions. Hence, no
annotation or keyword could possibly cover both use cases.

In short, explicit inlining is a bad tool for the wrong job.

### A C++ Problem

A common feature of modern C++ functions is that they are delivered via
header files. Equivalent traditional C++ and C functions would be
defined in source files, making it easy for the library author or
library user to optimize them in isolation.
 
This also makes it easy for the library user to step over them
during an interactive debugging session.
Indeed, if the user is unsure whether the function is their own, they
may habitually chose the 'step into' facility of the debugger and
automatically traverse the subsection of the call graph that is under
their control.

### A Niche Problem

The problem is not only a technical one. 

Firstly, it affects programs where performance of debug builds is
critical. This excludes batch programs and event-based user interfaces
where slower response to user input is not a deal-breaker.

Secondly, it only affects developers who use debuggers. There is 
[disagreement](https://twitter.com/PeterSommerlad/status/1078958027175329793)
about whether interactive debugging is even necessary in the era of
test-driven development. But it is clear that they are deemed necessary
by users in specific domains and have been for a long time.

The necessity for interactive debugging in select domains and the
reasons why this might pose a blind spot for the committee are not
subjects covered here.

### Somebody Else's Problem

Where the standard adds features which cause pain to users, it adds
injury to describe those features as a 'quality of implementation'
issue. That description is both true and inadequate.
Not only does the committee have an obligation
to deal with the consequences of its choices.
But it also has a unique ability to mediate between users and implementors.
Hopeful this is role that SG15 can fulfil.

### Conclusion of Problem Analysis

The direction C++ has been taking for a very long time is taking it in a
direction which is causing some users an increasing number of
productivity problems including:

1. slow, bloated debug builds;
2. back traces that include unwanted noise from extra-project code; and
3. hard-to-step-through call graphs.

Function inlining largely addresses all of the above problems when
applied to project dependencies at the expense of making 3) acute for
the project code itself. This trade-off results in a dilemma.
The author suggests that it is this dilemma which is the real problem.

## Straw Man Solution

In order to stimulate discussion of a workable solution to The Dilemma,
the following sub-section hypothesises a change to GCC (or Clang)
which — if implementable — could provide a tool chain-only solution that
could apply to existing source code unchanged.

### Proposed Change to GCC Option, `-Og`

[gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html)

`-Og`

<p style="margin-left: 40px">Optimize debugging experience.
<code>-Og</code> should be the optimization level of choice for the
standard edit-compile-debug cycle, offering a reasonable level of
optimization while maintaining fast compilation and a good debugging
experience. It is a better choice than <code>-O0</code> for producing
debuggable code because some compiler passes that collect debug
information are disabled at <code>-O0</code>.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">Like <code>-O0</code>, <code>-Og</code>
completely disables a number of optimization passes so that individual
options controlling them have no effect. Otherwise <code>-Og</code>
enables all <code>-O1</code> optimization flags except for those that
may interfere with debugging:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px">
<code>-fbranch-count-reg  -fdelayed-branch
-fif-conversion  -fif-conversion2
-finline-functions-called-once
-fmove-loop-invariants  -fssa-phiopt
-ftree-bit-ccp  -ftree-pta  -ftree-sra
</code></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; color: green; text-decoration: underline">
Additionally, <code>-Og</code> enables the following optimization flags
for functions defined in system headers (i.e. defined in headers found
via <code>-isystem</code>):</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px; color: green; text-decoration: underline">
<code>-finline-functions-called-once
-finline-functions
-finline-small-functions
</code></p>

### MSVC Option, `/Ob`

A similar MSVC facility can be envisaged with the experimental
`/external:I` switch as a substitute for `-isystem`.
This would involve a combination of switches such as

```shell
cl.exe /Od /Ob3 /external:IC:\somebody\elses\headers /IC:\my\project\headers C:\my\project\source\file.cpp 
```

where `/Ob3` is a novel function inlining option which
discriminates between 'system' (i.e. dependency) headers and 'project'
headers.

## FAQ

Q: Why inlining, specifically, and not other optimizations which would
   make code from dependencies faster?

A: For the sake of simplicity, this paper concentrates on what the
   author believes is the single most significant optimization
   technique.

## Impact On The Standard

None.
